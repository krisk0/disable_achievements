# Disable Achievements

Modification for Crusader Kings 3 that disables achievements.

## Motivation

I recently discovered that some of the code implementing achievements is buggy.

This mod completely disables achievements without copyright issues (that is without publishing copyrighted files or portions of them).

## Status

WIP, untested, use at your risk.

## TODO

`achievement list` on console should show nothing.

Delete body of all scripts in `common/scripted_effects/00_achievement_effects.txt`. If done with a Python script on user's computer, does not break copyright.

I am currently busy, will probably write the script later.
